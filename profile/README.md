# Open Resource Discovery

This GitHub organization contains the [Open Resource Discovery](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/) (ORD) specification and related projects that form an ecosystem around the standard.

ORD is a protocol that allows applications and services to self-describe their resources and capabilities (e.g. ports and adapters).
It is a general-purpose metadata publishing and discovery protocol, able to publish and transport metadata of various different (existing) standards. 

The ecosystem around ORD is therefore not just centered on ORD itself, but more generally how metadata and specifications can be created, validated, published and discovered.
