# Welcome to the Open Resource Discovery Project on GitHub

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of the Open Resource Discovery project. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS). Open Resource Discovery (ORD) is a protocol that allows applications and services to self-describe their resources and capabilities (e.g. ports and adapters).

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

## :handshake: Open Resource Discovery

Open Resource Discovery (ORD) helps software developers and providers to define how their services expose and discover their APIs, Events, capabilities and data. 
This includes practical concepts and examples of how technical services can implement a business reality over a distributed cloud-edge scenario using ORD-based semantic concepts.
It is a general-purpose metadata publishing and discovery protocol, able to publish and transport metadata of various different (existing) standards.
The ecosystem around ORD is therefore not just centered on ORD itself, but more generally how metadata and specifications can be created, validated, published and discovered

## :bear: Features

- **System Reflection:** Systems describe themselves with a single entry-point to crawl all relevant metadata. 
- **Uniform Standard:** ORD is a uniform standard for the description of different types of resources, and description of both the static / generic perspective and the actual runtime perspective.
